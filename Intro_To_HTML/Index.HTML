    <h1>Bluey</h1>
    <p>Bluey is a children's cartoon based in Australia. 
        The show follows the Heeler family, Bluey, Bingo, Bandit and Chilli as they navigate everyday things and situations. 
        I like watching this show with my daughter because not only does it teach real-life lessons to kids, but I also feel parents 
        can learn how to navigate the experience that is parenthood through the deeper episodes in the series.</p>

<h2>The Show</h2>
<p>Although Bluey, the main character is a blue dog, much like the infamous Blue from Blue's Clues she is a girl and most
    of her adventures center around herself and her little sister Bingo. Their parents Bandit and Chilli spend loads of effort
    making their children's childhoods full of fun and colorful experiences. They frequently teach life lessons that the girls can
    carry with them well into adulthood.</p>
    <p>I like that Bluey seems to focus on conscious parenting instead of corporal punishment or permissive parenting. The show
    places emphasis on being sure the parenting choices you make are teaching your children positive lessons as well as correcting
    negative behaviors. As a first time mom I was worried about being too permissive with my daughter but Bluey helped me be
    purposeful and positive yet authoritative with how the rules I set for her.</p>

<h3>Some Lessons Learned from watching Bluey</h3>

<hr>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.bluey.tv/" target="_blank"> Bluey Website</a></li>
    <li>Patience; there are several episodes in which being patient is the main task to tackle for both parents and kids.</li>
    <li>Kindness; as with most pairs of siblings, Bluey and Bingo have times where they can be less than nice to one another
        but their parents often remind them that family may not always see eye to eye however, they will always be sisters and should 
        treat each other with the same kindness they expect from others.</li>
    <li>Love; anyone who has kids knows that they are the first person to teach them how to accept and give love. I find that Bluey has 
        several episodes that show the reality of how children/parent dynamics test, grow, and display love to one another.</li>

<h4>Bluey Minisodes</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.bluey.tv/bluey-minisodes/" target="_blank"> Link To Bluey Minisodes</a></li>
    <li>BurgerDogs</li>
    <li>Three Pigs</li>
</ul>
<p>The two minisodes I named above are just two short clips that impacted me and how I parent my daughter. 
    I already refrain from lying to her so she doesn't begin to mimic a negative behavior but being reminded 
    that lying to children is damaging even if its something small was helpful enough for me to reinforce 
    that pattern of being honest with her even if its difficult to explain. This minisode alone keeps me from
    treating my daughter like she isn't capable of understanding things just because she's only a toddler, but 
    instead I make sure to let her know how I'm feeling in ways that are easy for her to take in. I don't dumb
    things down or talk to her like a baby because I know she understands what I'm saying and it will be easier
    later on for her to explain herself if I demonstrate the correct way for her as her role model.
