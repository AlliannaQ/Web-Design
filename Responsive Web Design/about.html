    <h1>The Show's Concepts and Themes</h1>
    <p>Criminal Minds is different from other police procedural shows because they focus more on the victims and criminals rather
        than the crime itself. Profilers analyze the country's most twisted criminal minds in an effort to anticipate their next
        moves before they strike again. Each team member brings his or her own area of expertise to the table as they pinpoint predators'
        motivations and identify their emotional triggers in the attempt to stop them.</p>

        <p>The original series, Criminal Minds, spanned fifteen years with a total of fifteen seasons or three hundred and twenty-four episodes.
            It spawned two spin-off series, Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior and Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, during its this time and,
            eventually, led to the revival spin-off Criminal Minds: Evolution.</p>
    <h2>Key Themes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Profiling and Psychology: The show delves into criminal psychology, 
            emphasizing the methods used by profilers to dissect the minds of criminals.</li>
        <li>Team Dynamics: It highlights the relationships and dynamics within the BAU team, 
            showcasing their personal struggles and growth throughout the series.</li>
        <li>Moral Dilemmas: Characters often confront ethical issues related to justice, punishment, 
            and the psychological impact of their work.</li>
    </ul>
