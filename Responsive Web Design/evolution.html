    <h1>Criminal Minds vs Criminal Minds: Evolution</h1>

    <h2>5 Differences between the Original and the Reboot</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Central Narrative: The biggest difference between Criminal Minds and Criminal Minds: Evolution is the central narrative. 
            The original series introduced viewers to a new case in every episode. 
            Following the episodic format, the BAU settled one case in each episode, exposing the threat. 
            However, in the reboot, viewers get to explore the master plan of Elias Voit, 
            a criminal who utilized social media and exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to create a huge connection with serial killers. 
            The series has been renewed for the third installment, and the BAU will continue exploring Voit's connections through 
            a serialized narrative.</li>
        <li>Progressive and tech-enhanced procedure: In the CBS show, the BAU extensively relied on traditional investigative procedures,
             including reports from the forensic department and psychological profiling of the characters by studying their actions and 
             behaviors. Even though the investigators utilized more technologies, these elements weren't deeply explored. 
             Conversely, the reboot shows how Viot used the internet and social media during the COVID-19 pandemic to build a 
             strong connection with murderers, whom the BAU has to hunt until the end. Utilizing modern technologies while solving 
             the case is the fundamental aspect of Criminal Minds: Evolution, as the series features how online platforms are being 
             exploited by criminals like Elias Viot to continue illegal activities.</li>
        <li>Political Theme: Throughout the fifteen seasons, the original show didn't focus much on political themes and 
            mainly relied on the psychological exploration of the corrupt individuals. The Behavioral Analysis Unit also 
            explored social issues during investigations, although digging into political narratives was rare. 
            In Criminal Minds: Evolution, viewers can explore government conspiracies, the dark side of law enforcement, 
            and how several individuals in power affect investigations, making them complex. 
            The series often tests the ethics practiced by government officials, making it a crucial element.</li>
        <li>Creative liberty and censorship: Since the original series debuted on CBS, Criminal Minds has faced significant 
            censorship and had to follow content guidelines. In addition, strict FCC regulations were implemented to ensure 
            that the procedural fits into the TV-14 rating and does not involve intent violence and mature themes. 
            However, the reboot enjoys creative freedom, and the makers could develop mature themes to add depth to the narrative. 
            The officials use explicit language, reflecting realism during heated interactions. 
            Viewers can see a drastic shift from preventing mature themes in the original show to featuring darker sides. 
            The story is more complicated than the episodic format, requiring broader themes and creative liberty.</li>
        <li>Attention To Character Driven Narratives: The CBS drama featured character development and individual stories of the characters, 
            but solving the criminal cases was the most critical task for the BAU. Their investigations always overshadowed personal struggles,
            giving less attention to individual narratives.
            In contrast, fans and viewers can witness each character's story in the Paramount+ series. 
            The show has prioritized the personal struggles of the BAU unit instead of tying them up with only criminal cases.
            As seen in the reboot, Jennifer Jareau is exhausted by balancing work and family. 
            Tara Lewis got into a new romantic relationship while handling a tough job, and others also deal with their problems. 
            So, Criminal Minds: Evolution perfectly blends high-profile investigators' personal and professional lives.</li>
