        <h1>Characters: Orginal Cast Members</h1>
        <img class="basic_picture" src="Images.cm/hotch3.jpg" alt="Image of Aaron Hotchner">
        <ul>
            <li>Aaron Hotchner: Former BAU Unit Chief. In terms of a psychological profile,
                Hotch keeps himself as an anchor around which chaos tends to reign, 
                believing that by doing so he can keep his team calm and ultimately make any mission a success.
                While likely facing abuse and probably having a past full of social roadblocks, 
                when it comes to his family his stark, serious demeanor tends to lighten up significantly, 
                making a very distinct difference between his “work” and “home” self. 
                Being motivated by both the safety of the public and his team, he has on a few occasions showed that these motivations
                can be turned into weaknesses, especially by his longtime rival, Mr. Scratch. It should also be noted that due to death
                of his first wife, (a casualty due to his career) his exit from the show is a sign of lessons learned; 
                Where he cannot bring his wife back, he can save his son from the same fate.</li>
            
                <li>Emily Elizabeth Prentiss: longtime member of the BAU who first joined the team two episodes after Elle Greenaway resigned from the FBI for good.
                At the end of Season Seven, she resigned from the BAU and accepted a position with Interpol in London.
                She was replaced by Alex Blake, who held the position until her own departure at the end of Season Nine.
                The position was then taken over by Kate Callahan for the duration of Season Ten before her own departure.
                She rejoined the team in Season Twelve and was then promoted to Unit Chief following the resignation of Aaron Hotchner.
                For a time, she was placed on administrative leave and suspension, pending an investigation by Assistant Director Linda Barnes;
                her position taken over by Jennifer Jareau temporarily. By 2022, Emily has been promoted to Section Chief, a position previously
                held by the late Erin Strauss and later Mateo Cruz.</li>
           
                <li>Penelope Garcia: She had been placed on one of the FBI's lists that concerned a small handful of extremely talented yet dangerous hackers in the world,
                and the FBI recruited her from there. Prior to her recruitment, she was a vigilante hacker mentored by Shane Wyeth,
                who would hack into companies and other businesses whom she felt were engaged in criminal activities, which attracted the
                attention of the FBI. Her hacker nickname was "The Black Queen", likely due to her habit of dressing in black, Gothic clothing,
                and makeup. The BAU arrested her in 2004 while they were investigating the case of John Nichols and Sam Russell. 
                She was given a choice to either work for them as their Technical Analyst (as Hotch deduced a kind and loving nature from her cyber-protests) or serve jail time;
                she decided to accept the job. According to Shane, she did so because she wanted to do something more useful and noble than violating and vandalizing websites.</li>
            
                <li>David Rossi: Born in Commack, Long Island, New York on May 9, 1956, Rossi served in the U.S. Marine Corps and made it to the rank of Sergeant Major.
                While a Private, he served in the Vietnam War under Sergeant Harrison Scott, who he would later refer to as the person who taught him to be honest.
                During his military service, Rossi earned several awards, including the Purple Heart.
                When he was younger, he had some association with a local mafia through a good friend named Ray Finnegan, but he severed his ties to them when he left town.
                Rossi is compassionate, very bold and can be loyal. 
                In the early beginning of Season Three, Rossi sees himself as a superior solely on his experience, whether it be challenging an unsub, or disregarding a strategy made by the rest of the team.
                Also, from beginning to the end of his arc in season three, Rossi feels that the old case is only his burden, and he doesn't share it until Morgan, Prentiss, and JJ, meet him to help him solve it. 
                The episode titled: "Damaged" is one of the first times that Rossi refers to the rest of the B.A.U. as his team. From then on, he is loyal to his team.</li>

        <h1>Characters: Orginal Cast Members</h1>
        <img class="basic_picture" src="Images.cm/reidheadshot.jpg" alt="Dr. Spencer Reid">
        <ul>
            <li>Jennifer Jareau: is a Supervisory Special Agent who was the BAU's former liaison with police and media officials.
                Upon her return in Season Seven, she officially becomes a profiler while her original position has gone to Aaron Hotchner
                (until his departure from the BAU) and Penelope Garcia. For a time, she was the acting unit chief of the BAU, taking over
                 as Emily Prentiss was placed on suspension, pending an investigation by Assistant Director Linda Barnes and was briefly terminated.</li>
            
            <li>Spencer Reid: Dr. Spencer "Spence" Reid is a Supervisory Special Agent with the BAU. He is hailed as a genius and an autodidact.
                Reid once mentioned that he was a victim of bullying in school where he was stripped naked and tied to a goalpost in front of other students.
                After waiting for all the other teenagers to leave, he walked home, only to find that his mother had not noticed he was so late to return
                because she had been having one of her schizophrenic episodes. Reid grew up learning nearly everything he knows from books, with his mother
                (a college professor of 15th-century literature) often reading to him. Still, Reid knew that the way his mother was living wasn't healthy. 
                When he was eighteen, he had Diana placed in a mental institution. Until Season Twelve, she resided in that same mental institution 
                and Reid had stated that he sent letters to Diana every day because of the guilt he felt for not visiting her. Reid is also worried
                about the fact that his mother's illness can be passed on genetically; he once told Morgan that "I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind".
                Reid has an eidetic memory, meaning that he can remember an exceedingly large amount of information with extraordinary detail.
                This, however, only definitely applies to information gathered visually (especially things he's read, as implied with the word eidetic). </li>
            
            <li>Derek Morgan: Derek Morgan is a former Supervisory Special Agent with the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.
                For a time, he was the acting unit chief of the BAU, taking over as Hotch stepped down temporally.
                Morgan specialized in explosives, fixations, and obsessive behaviors.
                He officially resigned from the BAU in Season Eleven in order to be with his new family. 
                He and his two sisters, Sarah and Desiree, grew up in a tough Chicago neighborhood. 
                The three of them were close to their paternal aunt Yvonne and cousin Cindi, whose house they would stay at whenever their parents were working.
                At the age of ten, Morgan was a witness to the shooting death of his father Hank, a police officer. 
                After his father's death, Morgan struggled somewhat with youthful fighting, earning him a juvenile criminal record. 
                He was taken under the wing of a local youth center coordinator, Carl Buford. 
                Buford acted as a surrogate father to Morgan, helping Morgan to obtain the aforementioned football scholarship, 
                but Buford was also sexually abusing him, which Morgan revealed several years later, under extreme duress.</li>
